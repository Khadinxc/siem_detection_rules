# SIEM Detection Rules
## all detection rules I've created stored in a singular location for my own reference and possibly others if they so choose too.
### Future Plans
| Title | Goal |
| --- | --- |
|Conversion to Splunk | The plan is to convert this architecture and integrate it into a Splunk instance.|
|Integration into Red teaming | Incorporate this lab into other TCM academy courses to detect on the Pen-testing and such that I'm learning about utilizing this knowledge to pass OSCP. |
|Continued Research | Continue my research into emerging threats, new exploits, new actors, and how to detect them.|
